IMPEDANCE AND RESISTANCE ANALYSIS

1. High impedance caused by:
- SEI thickening
- Cathode film buildup
- Poor electrolyte conductivity
- Poor wetting
- Cycling at low temperature

2. If cell shows:
- High IR @ high SOC → cathode issue
- High IR @ low SOC → anode issue

3. Fix:
- Add VC/FEC
- Reduce voltage limit
- Improve wetting by vacuum filling
