1. OVERVIEW OF NMC

NMC = Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide
Formula: LiNixMnyCozO2 where x + y + z = 1

Common compositions:
- NMC 111: Ni:Mn:Co = 1:1:1
- NMC 532: 5:3:2
- NMC 622: 6:2:2
- NMC 811: 8:1:1

2. ROLE OF EACH ELEMENT

Nickel:
- Increases energy density
- Increases capacity
- But reduces thermal stability at very high content

Manganese:
- Improves structural stability
- Helps safety and lower cost

Cobalt:
- Improves electronic conductivity
- Stabilizes layered structure
- Expensive and supply-limited

3. KEY FEATURES

- Higher energy density than LFP
- Nominal cell voltage ~3.6–3.7 V
- Good compromise between energy, power, and cycle life

4. TRADE-OFFS BY GRADE

NMC 111:
- Older generation, more Co
- Good stability, lower energy

NMC 622:
- Balanced solution for modern EVs
- Good energy and life

NMC 811:
- Very high energy
- Lower Co content (cost advantage)
- Requires careful control of manufacturing and BMS to ensure safety

5. WHEN TO RECOMMEND NMC

Use NMC when:
- High range per charge is required (cars, premium EVs)
- Space is limited
- Balanced performance is needed

Downside:
- More sensitive to abuse than LFP
- Needs robust thermal management and BMS
