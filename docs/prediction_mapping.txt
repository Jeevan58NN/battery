HOW TO USE PREDICTION OUTPUT IN DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS

If the user prediction model outputs:
- Low capacity → Suggest increasing cathode loading or using NMC
- High resistance → Suggest thinner electrodes or better electrolyte
- Poor cycle life → Suggest reducing silicon %, using additives

Prediction output → RAG → Final answer synthesis
