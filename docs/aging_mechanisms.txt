BATTERY AGING MECHANISMS

1. Calendar Aging:
- Caused by time, even without usage
- Increased by high temperature (>40°C)
- Fix: store at 40–60% SOC

2. Cycle Aging:
- SEI growth
- Electrode particle cracking
- Loss of active material

3. High-Voltage Aging:
- Charging above manufacturer limit accelerates cathode breakdown

4. Solutions:
- Reduce charge voltage
- Improve SEI via additives
- Optimize cycling window (20–80% SOC)
