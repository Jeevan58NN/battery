PARAMETER TUNING GUIDE

If user asks: “What should I change to achieve X?”

1. To increase voltage:
- Use cathode with higher redox potential
- Use HV electrolyte
- Reduce anode potential (graphite instead of LTO)

2. To increase current:
- Reduce electrode thickness
- Increase porosity
- Increase temperature (if safe)
- Improve electrolyte conductivity

3. To improve cycle life:
- Reduce silicon %
- Use electrolyte additives (VC, FEC)
- Reduce charge voltage limit

4. To increase safety:
- Switch to LFP cathode
- Increase separator thickness
- Add flame-retardant additives

5. To improve energy density:
- Use NMC811 or NCA
- Increase cathode loading
- Reduce porosity slightly
