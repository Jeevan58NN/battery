1. ELECTRODE MANUFACTURING

Slurry preparation:
- Active material (e.g., NMC, LFP, graphite)
- Conductive additives (e.g., carbon black)
- Binder (PVDF, CMC/SBR)
- Solvent (NMP for PVDF, water for CMC/SBR)
- Mixed in a high-shear mixer to form uniform slurry

Coating:
- Slurry is coated on:
  - Aluminum foil for cathode
  - Copper foil for anode
- Using slot-die or comma-coater

Drying:
- Solvent is evaporated in ovens
- Proper drying avoids cracks and ensures adhesion

Calendaring:
- Electrodes are passed through rollers
- Adjusted to required thickness and density
- Impacts porosity, energy density, and rate capability

Slitting:
- Coated foils are cut into appropriate widths


2. CELL ASSEMBLY

Cell formats:
- Cylindrical (e.g., 18650, 21700)
- Prismatic
- Pouch

Main steps:
- Electrode cutting into final shapes
- Stacking (prismatic, pouch) or winding (cylindrical)
- Adding separator between anode and cathode
- Welding tabs and current collectors
- Inserting into can (or pouch forming)
- Drying in dry room to remove moisture

3. ELECTROLYTE FILLING

- Done in dry room or vacuum chamber
- Electrolyte (e.g., LiPF6 in organic solvent) is injected
- Vacuum helps remove trapped air and ensure full wetting

4. FORMATION AND AGING

Formation:
- First few charge–discharge cycles at controlled rates
- SEI layer forms on the anode
- Very critical step for battery life

Aging:
- Cells are stored at controlled temperature for some days
- To stabilize SEI and electrode–electrolyte interfaces
- After aging, cells are graded (capacity, impedance, leakage)

5. PACK ASSEMBLY

- Cells grouped into modules
- Modules grouped into pack
- Add BMS, sensors, cooling plates, busbars, fuses, enclosure

Quality Control:
- Capacity test
- Leakage and insulation test
- Safety and reliability tests at cell, module, and pack levels
