TEMPERATURE PERFORMANCE RULES

1. Cold Temperature (<10°C):
- Ion mobility drops → higher resistance
- Graphite risk: lithium plating
- Use LTO or graphite with low-temp electrolyte

Capacity drops:
- At 0°C → -20 to -30%
- At -10°C → -40 to -60%

2. Hot Temperature (>45°C):
- SEI breakdown accelerates
- High-Ni materials gas heavily
- Use LFP or LMO

3. Ideal Temperature:
- 20–30°C

4. If user asks:
“What happens at ___ °C?”
→ Check:
   - electrolyte stability
   - SEI health
   - cathode thermal stability
