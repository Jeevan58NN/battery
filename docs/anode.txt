1. ROLE OF ANODE

The anode is the negative electrode in a Li-ion battery.
During charging, Li+ ions store in the anode.
During discharge, Li+ leave the anode and go to the cathode.

A good anode:
- Stores a lot of Li+ (high specific capacity)
- Maintains structure during cycling
- Forms stable SEI (Solid Electrolyte Interphase)
- Has good electrical conductivity


2. COMMON ANODE MATERIALS

Graphite (most widely used)
- Structure: layered carbon
- Theoretical capacity ~372 mAh/g
- Li+ intercalates between carbon layers (forming LiC6)
- Pros: Mature, stable, good cycle life, cheap
- Cons: Limited capacity, risk of lithium plating at high rates or low temperature

Hard Carbon
- Disordered carbon, used in sodium-ion batteries
- Larger pores and defects
- Pros: Suitable for Na+ storage, good for low-temperature performance
- Cons: Lower initial coulombic efficiency

Silicon and Silicon–Graphite Composite
- Silicon has huge capacity (~3579 mAh/g), 10× graphite
- Problem: ~300% volume expansion during lithiation
- This causes particle cracking, SEI breaking, and capacity fade
- Industry solution: Use a small percentage of silicon in graphite anodes + special binders (e.g., PAA, CMC)

Lithium Metal
- Used in next-gen solid-state batteries
- Extremely high specific capacity (~3860 mAh/g)
- Lightest metal
- Main issue: Dendrite formation, safety concerns


3. KEY ANODE CHALLENGES

Lithium plating:
- Happens when charging too fast, at low temperature, or overcharging
- Metallic Li deposits on the anode surface
- Can form dendrites → internal short circuit → thermal runaway

SEI formation:
- Necessary protective layer formed on anode
- Consumes some Li+ during first cycles → irreversible capacity loss
- Stable SEI is essential for long cycle life

Mechanical stress:
- Volume change of anode materials (especially silicon) causes stress
- Can lead to cracks and loss of electrical contact


4. ANODE DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS

- Use nano-structured materials to reduce stress
- Use elastic binders to accommodate volume changes
- Optimize particle size and porosity
- Design electrolyte additives to form stable SEI
