1. WHAT IS A BATTERY?

A battery is a device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy.
It does this using a REDOX (reduction–oxidation) reaction.

Basic parts of a rechargeable Li-ion cell:
- Cathode: positive electrode (usually metal oxide)
- Anode: negative electrode (usually carbon/graphite)
- Electrolyte: liquid or solid medium that carries Li+ ions
- Separator: porous plastic film that prevents short circuit but allows ions
- Current collectors: Al foil (cathode) and Cu foil (anode)
- Casing: cylinder, pouch, or prismatic can

When charging:
- Li+ ions move from cathode → anode through the electrolyte
- Electrons move through the external circuit into the anode

When discharging:
- Li+ move from anode → cathode
- Electrons flow through the external load and do useful work


2. IMPORTANT TERMS

Cell: Single electrochemical unit (e.g., one 18650 cell)
Module: Group of cells connected together
Pack: Group of modules with BMS, cooling, sensors, casing

Capacity (Ah or mAh):
- How much charge the battery can store
- Higher capacity → runs a device longer

Voltage (V):
- Electrical potential difference
- Nominal voltage of Li-ion cell ≈ 3.6–3.7 V (depends on chemistry)

Energy (Wh):
- Energy = Capacity (Ah) × Voltage (V)
- Example: 3 Ah × 3.7 V = 11.1 Wh

Energy density:
- Energy per unit mass (Wh/kg) or volume (Wh/L)
- Higher energy density → higher range for EVs

Power density:
- How fast energy can be delivered (W/kg)
- Important for acceleration, drones, power tools

Cycle life:
- Number of full charge–discharge cycles before capacity falls to ~80% of original


3. TYPES OF RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES

Lithium-ion (Li-ion)
- Most common in phones, laptops, EVs
- High energy density
- Many cathode chemistries (LFP, NMC, NCA, etc.)

Lithium polymer (LiPo)
- Li-ion but with polymer-type electrolyte or pouch packaging

Lead-acid
- Cheap, used in cars for starting, lighting, ignition (SLI)
- Low energy density, heavy

Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH)
- Used in some hybrid vehicles and older electronics

Sodium-ion (Na-ion)
- Emerging technology
- Uses Na+ instead of Li+
- Lower cost and good for stationary storage


4. HOW CELLS ARE ARRANGED

Series connection:
- Voltages add up, capacity stays same
- Example: 3 cells in series (3S) of 3.7 V each → 11.1 V

Parallel connection:
- Capacities add up, voltage stays same
- Example: 2 cells in parallel (2P) of 2 Ah each → 4 Ah total

Packs use combinations:
- Example: 96S4P pack in EV → high voltage and high capacity


5. WHERE BATTERIES ARE USED

- Consumer electronics (phones, laptops, wearables)
- Electric vehicles (2W, 3W, cars, buses)
- Energy storage systems (home, grid-level)
- Drones and UAVs
- Power tools and industrial applications
