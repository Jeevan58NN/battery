1. BASIC CHARGING METHOD (LI-ION)

Standard profile: CC–CV (Constant Current – Constant Voltage)

Step 1: Constant Current (CC)
- Battery is charged with fixed current (e.g., 0.5C or 1C)
- Voltage rises gradually

Step 2: Constant Voltage (CV)
- When voltage reaches upper limit (e.g., 4.2 V for many Li-ion cells)
- Charger holds voltage constant
- Current gradually decreases
- Charging stops when current falls below a threshold (e.g., 0.05C)


2. CHARGING TERMS

C-rate:
- 1C means charging current equals capacity
  - For 2 Ah cell, 1C = 2 A
- 0.5C for 2 Ah cell = 1 A

Fast charging:
- Charging at high C-rates (e.g., 2C, 3C)
- Generates more heat
- Increases degradation if not managed properly


3. FACTORS AFFECTING SAFE CHARGING

Temperature:
- Too cold (< 0°C): risk of lithium plating
- Too hot (> 45–50°C): accelerates degradation and safety risk

Voltage limit:
- Charging above recommended max voltage → fast degradation and safety risk

Current limit:
- Too high current → more heat, more stress


4. GOOD CHARGING PRACTICES

- Avoid frequent 0–100% full cycles if not needed
- For EVs, daily use in 20–80% SOC range improves life
- Avoid fast charging all the time
- Do not charge in very hot or very cold conditions
