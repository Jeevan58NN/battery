1. WHAT IS A BMS?

BMS = Battery Management System
It is the "brain" of the battery pack.

Main functions:
- Monitor
- Protect
- Estimate
- Communicate


2. KEY FUNCTIONS

Monitoring:
- Cell voltages
- Pack voltage
- Charge/discharge current
- Temperatures at different points

Protection:
- Cut off charging if voltage too high
- Cut off discharging if voltage too low
- Limit current if too high
- Shut down if temperature is unsafe

Estimation:
- SOC (State of Charge)
- SOH (State of Health)
- Remaining range (for EVs)

Balancing:
- Equalize voltages between cells
- Can be passive (bleeding resistors) or active (charge transfer)


3. SOC ESTIMATION METHODS (BASIC VIEW)

- Coulomb counting:
  - Integrate current over time
  - Needs accurate current measurement and drift correction

- Voltage-based:
  - Use open-circuit voltage vs SOC curve
  - Works when battery is at rest

- Model-based:
  - Uses equivalent circuit models and filters (e.g., Kalman filter)
  - More accurate but more complex


4. IMPORTANCE OF BMS

Without BMS:
- High risk of overcharge/overdischarge
- Shorter battery life
- Unsafe operation

With good BMS:
- Longer cycle life
- Better user experience (range prediction)
- Safety compliance
