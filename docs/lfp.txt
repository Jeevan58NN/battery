1. OVERVIEW OF LFP

LFP = Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4)
- Olivine structure
- Nominal cell voltage ~3.2–3.3 V
- Specific capacity ~150–170 mAh/g

2. ADVANTAGES

- Very safe → strong P–O bond, less oxygen release
- Excellent thermal stability, low risk of thermal runaway
- Long cycle life (3000–8000 cycles possible)
- Good for frequent charge–discharge (buses, taxis)
- Can operate well at partial state of charge
- Lower cost due to iron and phosphorus (no Ni or Co)

3. DISADVANTAGES

- Lower energy density than NMC/NCA
- Larger pack needed for same range
- Lower voltage (3.2 V vs 3.6–3.7 V of NMC)

4. TYPICAL USE CASES

- Electric buses and commercial EVs
- Entry-level and mass-market EVs
- Two-wheelers and three-wheelers
- Stationary energy storage (home, grid)
- Applications where safety and life are more important than compact size

5. WHEN TO RECOMMEND LFP

Use LFP when:
- Safety is top priority
- Long cycle life is needed
- High temperature environment
- Cost-sensitive applications
- Daily deep cycling (energy storage)
