1. SAFETY RISKS IN LI-ION BATTERIES

Main hazards:
- Thermal runaway
- Fire and explosion
- Toxic or flammable gas release

Thermal runaway:
- Uncontrolled increase in temperature
- Exothermic reactions inside cell
- Triggered by:
  - Internal short circuit
  - External short circuit
  - Overcharge
  - Mechanical damage (crush, nail penetration)
  - Overheating from environment or other cells


2. THERMAL RUNAWAY PROCESS (SIMPLIFIED)

- SEI breaks down at high temperature
- Electrolyte decomposes, generating gas and heat
- Cathode starts releasing oxygen at high temp
- Oxygen reacts with electrolyte and anode → more heat
- If not stopped, leads to venting, flame, or explosion


3. SAFETY FEATURES AT CELL LEVEL

- Separator with shutdown function (melts and closes pores)
- Current interrupt device (CID) in cylindrical cells
- Positive temperature coefficient (PTC) device
- Safety vents on cylindrical/prismatic cells
- Flame-retardant electrolyte additives (partially)


4. SAFETY FEATURES AT PACK LEVEL

- Fuses and contactors
- BMS protections:
  - Overcharge protection
  - Overdischarge protection
  - Overcurrent protection
  - Overtemperature protection
  - Cell balancing
- Thermal management: cooling channels, phase-change material
- Robust mechanical enclosure


5. SAFETY TESTS

- Overcharge test
- External short circuit test
- Nail penetration test
- Crush test
- Thermal shock / thermal abuse test
- Drop test

Standards depend on application (UN38.3, IEC, UL, AIS etc).
