CAPACITY DESIGN RULES

1. Capacity is proportional to:
- Cathode loading (mg/cm²)
- Active material %
- Particle size (smaller → more surface area)

2. Increase Capacity by:
- Higher nickel cathodes (NMC811)
- Silicon composite anodes
- Thicker electrodes + good ion pathways

3. If user asks:
“How to increase capacity?”
→ Suggest increasing loading, switching cathode, adding Si.
