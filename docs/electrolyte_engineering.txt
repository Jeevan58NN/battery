ELECTROLYTE ENGINEERING GUIDE

1. Standard Li-ion Electrolyte:
- 1M LiPF6 in EC:EMC (3:7)
- Pros: high conductivity, stable SEI for graphite
- Cons: unstable above 4.3V

2. High-Voltage Electrolyte:
- LiPF6 or LiFSI in Fluoroethylene Carbonate (FEC), Fluorinated Solvents (FEMC, FDEC)
- Needed for voltages > 4.4V
- For high-voltage spinel (4.7V), add PES additive.

3. Low-Temperature Electrolyte:
Use:
- LiTFSI + low-viscosity solvents
- High EMC/DMC ratio
- Avoid high EC content
Result: Better ion mobility at <10°C

4. High-Power Electrolyte:
- Lower viscosity formulation → faster ion transport
- Add 2–3% VC to stabilize SEI
- Used in drones, power tools.

5. If user asks:
“What electrolyte for ___ chemistry + temp ___?”
→ Choose based on stability window + viscosity + SEI needs.
