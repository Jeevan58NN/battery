CELL VOLTAGE DESIGN RULES

1. Voltage of a Li-ion cell is determined mainly by:
- Cathode redox potential
- Anode redox potential
- Electrolyte stability window

General rule:
Cell voltage = Cathode potential – Anode potential

Typical potentials vs Li/Li+:
- Graphite anode: ~0.1 V
- Silicon anode: 0.2–0.4 V
- LTO (Lithium Titanate) anode: 1.55 V

Cathode potentials:
- LFP: ~3.45 V
- NMC 622: ~3.8 V
- NMC 811: ~3.9 V
- NCA: ~3.9 V
- LCO: ~4.0 V
- High-voltage spinel LMO: ~4.7 V

Therefore:
- Graphite + LFP → 3.2–3.3 V cell
- Graphite + NMC → 3.6–3.7 V cell
- Graphite + LCO → 3.7 V cell
- Graphite + high-voltage LMO → up to 4.7 V cell
- LTO + LFP → ~1.9–2.0 V cell (very safe but low voltage)

TO REACH 5 VOLT CELL:
→ No standard Li-ion chemistry gives stable 5 V.
→ Requires:
  - High-voltage cathode (LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 spinel at ~4.7 V)
  - Very stable electrolyte (requires fluorinated solvents)
  - Anode must be graphite or silicon-graphite
  - Additives: LiDFOB, LiFSI, PES additive for stability

If user asks:
"I need 5V cell" → Suggest 4.7 V spinel + Si/C composite + HV electrolyte
