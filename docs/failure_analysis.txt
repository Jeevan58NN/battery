FAILURE DIAGNOSIS RULES

Common failures:
1. Lithium Plating
- Caused by: fast charging, cold temperature
- Fix: reduce charge rate, increase temperature, use FEC additive

2. SEI Cracking
- Caused by silicon expansion
- Fix: use elastic binders (CMC/SBR), add FEC

3. Thermal Runaway
- Caused by internal short, gas evolution
- Fix: use LFP, shutdown separator, BMS protection

4. Gas Formation
- Caused by electrolyte breakdown
- Fix: lower upper voltage, add additives, use high-stability electrolytes

5. Capacity Fade
- Caused by cathode dissolution or loss of lithium inventory
- Fix: reduce voltage limit, improve SEI

Bot must analyze symptoms → map to cause → give solution.
