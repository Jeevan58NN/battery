BATTERY DESIGN DECISION RULES

The bot should follow these rules:

1. Target Voltage:
If needed voltage < 3.3V → LFP
If 3.4–3.7V → NMC or NCA
If > 4.4V → High-voltage LMO

2. Target Current:
Low ( < 1A ) → Any chemistry
Medium (1–3A) → NMC or LFP
High ( >3A ) → LMO or LFP with thin electrodes

3. Temperature:
Cold (<10°C):
- Use LTO or graphite anode with FEC-rich electrolyte

Hot (>45°C):
- Prefer LFP or LMO cathode
- Avoid high-Ni materials

4. Safety Priority:
- LFP > LMO > NMC > NCA

5. High Energy Priority:
- NCA > NMC 811 > NMC 622 > LCO

6. If user provides impossible combination:
Bot must say:
"This chemical combination is not physically achievable. Consider adjusting the cathode/anode/electrolyte to meet voltage/power requirements."

7. If required voltage is too high:
Recommend series connection:
Example: 5V needed → Use 2 × 2.5V cells in series (LFP)
