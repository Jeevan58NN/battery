1. EV BATTERY REQUIREMENTS

- High energy density (for range)
- Adequate power (for acceleration and regen braking)
- Long cycle and calendar life (8–15 years)
- High safety level
- Wide operating temperature range
- Fast charging capability
- Cost-effective


2. CHEMISTRY CHOICES

LFP in EVs:
- Pros: Safe, long life, cheaper, good for buses and mass-market EVs
- Cons: Lower energy density, larger pack

NMC/NCA in EVs:
- Pros: Higher energy density, more range for same pack size
- Cons: More sensitive to abuse, more complex thermal management, more expensive


3. PACK VOLTAGE AND CAPACITY

- Small EVs: 48–96 V packs
- Passenger cars: 300–800 V packs (high-voltage architecture)
- Higher voltage → lower current for same power → thinner cables, less heat


4. EV-SPECIFIC BMS FEATURES

- Cell balancing across large number of cells
- Range estimation and prediction
- Charge control with fast chargers (CCS, CHAdeMO, GB/T)
- Thermal management integration
- Fault diagnostics and logging


5. APPLICATION-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

Two-wheelers:
- Prefer LFP or LFP-based packs
- Focus on safety, cost, and moderate range

City buses:
- Often use LFP
- Many cycles per day, opportunity charging

Passenger cars:
- Mix of NMC, NCA, and LFP depending on segment
- High-range models prefer high-Ni chemistries (NMC 811, NCA)
