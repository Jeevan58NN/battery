# Material Compatibility Matrix – What Works With What

1. Cathode → Anode compatibility:
   - NMC → Graphite / Hard Carbon
   - LNMO → Hard Carbon preferred (graphite OK with additives)
   - LFP → Graphite / Hard Carbon / LTO
   - LCO → Graphite (ONLY)

2. Cathode → Electrolyte compatibility:
   LNMO → Needs high-voltage electrolyte (LiFSI + additives)
   LCO → Needs Co-stabilizers (VC, FEC)
   NMC → Works with most standard electrolytes
   LFP → Works with almost all electrolytes

3. Anode → Electrolyte compatibility:
   Graphite → EC/DMC + FEC
   Hard Carbon → EC-free OK
   LTO → Universal compatibility

4. Temperature matching:
   - High temp (>45°C): avoid EC, use FEC + TMS
   - Low temp: LTO + ether-based electrolyte
