# Current (Amp) Prediction – Based on Materials & Structure

1. Current output (A) increases with:
   - Higher cathode surface area
   - Lower internal resistance
   - High-conductivity electrolyte
   - Higher temperature (up to 45°C)

2. Cathode material ranking for high current:
   Highest → LMO > LNMO > NMC > LCO > LFP → Lowest

3. Anode influence:
   - Graphite: good up to 3C
   - Hard carbon: moderate power
   - LTO: BEST for high current (20C possible)

4. To achieve target current (e.g., 3 A):
   - Increase carbon black % to 5–6%
   - Decrease cathode thickness to < 60 µm
   - Use low-viscosity electrolyte (EC-free)
   - Ensure porosity around 30–35%

5. Temperature effects:
   - +10°C → Current capability increases ~8–12%
   - > 55°C → Rapid degradation
