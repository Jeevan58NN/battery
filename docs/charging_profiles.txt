CHARGING PROFILES AND RULES

1. Constant Current – Constant Voltage (CC–CV)
- Standard lithium-ion method.
- CC until 4.2V (NMC/LCO), then CV.
- For LFP → 3.65V CV.

2. Fast Charging Rules:
- Increase current only if:
   → Temperature 20–35°C
   → Internal resistance low
- Additives needed:
   → FEC, LiDFOB for SEI stability
- Silicon anodes cannot fast charge aggressively.

3. Charging Limits:
- High-Ni cathodes (NMC811, NCA) degrade if charged above 4.25V.
- LFP is safest for fast charging.

4. Safety Rules:
- Overcharge → lithium plating → thermal runaway
- Suggest lower C-rate for cold temperatures.

5. If user asks:
“How to reduce charging time?”
→ Suggest higher C-rate, preheating, low-impedance electrolyte.
