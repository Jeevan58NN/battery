1. WHY THERMAL MANAGEMENT IS IMPORTANT

Battery performance and life are strongly affected by temperature.
Ideal operating range (approx):
- 20–35°C for many Li-ion chemistries

High temperature:
- Increases side reactions
- Speeds up degradation
- Can lead to thermal runaway

Low temperature:
- Increases internal resistance
- Reduces power and capacity
- Increases risk of lithium plating during charging


2. THERMAL MANAGEMENT METHODS

Air cooling:
- Simple fans and air channels around modules
- Used in some hybrids and smaller packs

Liquid cooling:
- Coolant channels or cold plates in contact with cells/modules
- More effective for large EV packs
- Allows uniform temperature control

Refrigerant-based:
- Uses vehicle AC refrigerant circuit
- Direct cooling of pack (more complex but efficient)

Heating:
- Resistive heating elements
- Heat pumps reusing waste heat
- Needed in cold climates


3. DESIGN GOALS

- Keep all cells within safe temperature range
- Minimize temperature gradient between cells
- Quickly remove heat during fast charging and high power discharge
- Support pre-conditioning (pre-heat or pre-cool before use)


4. THERMAL RUNAWAY PROPAGATION CONTROL

- Use thermal barriers between cells
- Use non-flammable materials where possible
- Design venting paths away from passengers (in EVs)
