1. INTRODUCTION TO BATTERIES

A battery is an electrochemical device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy.
A typical lithium-ion battery consists of:

Cathode (positive electrode)

Anode (negative electrode)

Electrolyte

Separator

Current Collectors

Battery Management System

Battery performance depends heavily on materials, manufacturing processes, and operational conditions.

2. CATHODE MATERIALS

Cathodes determine the energy density, voltage, and performance.

Common Cathode Types

NMC – Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide

Used in EVs

High energy density

Grade examples:

NMC 111, NMC 532, NMC 622, NMC 811

Higher nickel → higher energy

Higher manganese → stability

Higher cobalt → safety, cycle life

LFP – Lithium Iron Phosphate

Very safe

Long cycle life (3000–8000 cycles)

Lower energy density (160–200 Wh/kg)

Excellent thermal stability

Preferred for:

Energy storage

Mass-market EVs

Two-wheelers

NCA – Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide

High energy

Used by Tesla

Slightly lower cycle life than LFP

LMO – Lithium Manganese Oxide

High power

Good for high discharge rate applications

Lower longevity

LCO – Lithium Cobalt Oxide

Used in mobile phones

High energy

Expensive due to cobalt content

3. ANODE MATERIALS

Anodes store lithium during charging.

Types:

Graphite (Synthetic / Natural)

Most common

350–370 mAh/g

Requires SEI formation

Hard Carbon

Used in sodium-ion batteries

High surface disorder

Silicon-Graphite Composite

Very high energy

420–450 mAh/g

But volume expansion is problematic

Requires advanced binders

Lithium Metal

Used in solid-state batteries

Extremely high energy

Dendrite formation is a challenge

4. ELECTROLYTES

Electrolytes enable lithium-ion movement.

Types:

Liquid Electrolyte

LiPF6 salt in solvents like

6. SEI (Solid Electrolyte Interphase)

A passivation layer formed on the anode during initial charge.

Purpose:

Prevents continuous electrolyte decomposition

Reduces irreversible lithium loss

Enables stable cycle life

Weak SEI = swelling, gas formation, capacity fade.
