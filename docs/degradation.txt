1. WHAT IS BATTERY DEGRADATION?

Degradation = gradual loss of capacity, power, or efficiency over time.
Main types:
- Capacity fade (loss of Ah)
- Power fade (higher internal resistance)


2. MAJOR DEGRADATION MECHANISMS

Loss of Lithium Inventory (LLI):
- Li+ gets trapped in SEI or side products
- Less active lithium is available for cycling
- Common cause of early capacity loss

Loss of Active Material (LAM):
- Cathode or anode material becomes inactive
- Due to cracking, phase change, or side reactions

SEI Growth:
- SEI thickens over time
- Increases internal resistance
- Consumes more lithium

Lithium Plating:
- Metallic lithium deposits on anode surface
- Happens during:
  - Fast charging
  - Low temperature charging
  - Overcharge
- Dangerous because of dendrite formation

Electrolyte Decomposition:
- High voltage or high temperature can decompose electrolyte
- Produces gases → swelling
- Forms unwanted surface films

Particle Cracking:
- Volume change during cycling causes mechanical stress
- Cracks expose fresh surface → more SEI, more side reactions


3. FACTORS THAT ACCELERATE DEGRADATION

- High temperature (both storage and operation)
- Keeping battery at 100% SOC for long periods
- Deep charge/discharge cycles (0–100%) repeatedly
- Very high C-rate charging and discharging
- Operation outside recommended voltage window


4. HOW TO REDUCE DEGRADATION

Cell design:
- Optimized electrode thickness, porosity
- Stable cathode and anode materials
- Electrolyte additives for stable SEI

Pack design:
- Thermal management (cooling plates, coolant, fans)
- Uniform temperature across pack

BMS strategies:
- Avoid very high SOC and very low SOC
- Limit fast charging when cold
- Use conservative current limits
- Cell balancing

User habits:
- Avoid leaving device at 0% or 100% for long time
- Avoid storing at high temperature
- Prefer partial charges (e.g., 20–80% for EVs)
