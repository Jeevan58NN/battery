# Battery Combination Rules – Basic (Voltage, Amp Output, Compatibility)

1. Voltage is determined by:  Cathode V_max  –  Anode V
   Typical:
   - Graphite (0.1V)
   - Hard Carbon (0.05–0.1V)
   - LTO (1.6V) → LOW VOLTAGE CELLS ONLY

2. Required Voltage Formula:
   Cathode V_max ≈ Target Voltage + Anode Voltage

   Example:
   Target = 5V, Anode = Graphite (0.1V)
   Required Cathode ≈ 5.1V → Options:
       - LNMO (4.7V) *needs special electrolyte*
       - HED NMC (4.5–4.8V)

3. Current Output (Amps) depends on:
   - Cathode particle size (smaller → higher current)
   - Electrode thickness (thinner → higher current)
   - Electrolyte ionic conductivity
   - Temperature: conductivity ↑ with heat (up to 45°C)
   - Carbon percentage in both electrodes

4. Temperature Rules:
   - > 50°C → Avoid EC-based electrolytes, use FEC or borate additives.
   - < 0°C → Avoid graphite, use LTO.
   - 20–35°C → All chemistries normal.

5. Electrolyte Compatibility:
   - High voltage: needs additives (LiDFOB, LiFSI, LiBOB).
   - LNMO cathode: must use HF-resistant electrolyte.
   - LTO: works with almost all standard electrolytes.
