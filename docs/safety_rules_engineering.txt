SAFETY ENGINEERING RULES

1. Safest cathode:
LFP > LMO > NMC > NCA > LCO

2. If user asks:
"Which combination is safest?"
→ Recommend:
LFP + graphite + shutdown separator + 1% TMSP additive

3. Prevent thermal runaway:
- Lower charge voltage
- Add flame retardant electrolyte
- Increase separator thickness

4. Avoid:
- High-Ni cathodes at >60°C
- Silicon anodes without strong SEI additive
