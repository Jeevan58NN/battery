MANUFACTURING DEFECTS AND THEIR EFFECTS

1. Over-Calendered Electrode:
- Low porosity → poor ion movement
- Results: low power, high heat
- Fix: reduce calender pressure by 5–10%

2. Under-Calendered Electrode:
- Too porous → low energy density
- Fix: increase pressure slightly

3. Poor Mixing:
- Slurry not uniform → inconsistent capacity
- Fix: increase mixing time, improve binder mixing sequence

4. Electrode Misalignment:
- Causes internal shorts or uneven SEI

5. Improper Drying:
- Moisture reacts with LiPF6 → HF formation → gas generation

Bot must identify and recommend manufacturing fixes.
