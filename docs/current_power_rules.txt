CURRENT (AMP) AND POWER DESIGN RULES

1. Output current depends on:
- Electrode thickness
- Porosity
- Particle size
- Conductive additives
- Electrolyte ionic conductivity
- Temperature
- Separator resistance

2. To achieve HIGH CURRENT (3A, 5A, 10A):
Use:
- LMO or LFP cathode (high power)
- Graphite or LTO anode
- Thin electrodes (lower internal resistance)
- High porosity (better ion transport)
- Conductive carbon (Super P, CNT)
- High-power electrolyte with low viscosity
- Wide-pore separator

3. High power combinations:
- LFP + graphite → very safe, high power
- LMO + graphite → highest power capability
- NMC 622 + graphite → good power + energy balance

4. When user asks: “How to get 3A output?”
Recommend:
- Reduce electrode thickness by 15–20%
- Increase conductive carbon by 0.5–1%
- Use electrolyte: 1M LiPF6 in EC:EMC = 3:7 + 2% VC
- Ensure temperature 20–30°C

5. If temperature is LOW (<10°C):
- Power drops 20–30%
- Suggest heating or low-temperature electrolyte
