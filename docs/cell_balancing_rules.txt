CELL BALANCING RULES (FOR BATTERY PACKS)

1. Cells in series MUST be balanced or pack fails.

2. Passive balancing:
- Burn excess energy through resistors.

3. Active balancing:
- Move charge between cells.
- Used in EVs.

4. If user asks:
“My pack is unbalanced”
→ Recommend:
  - reduce charging voltage temporarily
  - run balance cycle
  - check internal resistance mismatch
