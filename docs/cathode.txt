1. ROLE OF CATHODE

Cathode is the positive electrode in a Li-ion battery.
It is usually a lithium-containing metal oxide.
During discharge:
- Li+ move from anode → cathode
- Electrons move through external circuit to cathode

Cathode largely decides:
- Energy density
- Voltage
- Cost
- Safety


2. MAIN CATHODE CHEMISTRIES

LCO (Lithium Cobalt Oxide, LiCoO2)
- Used in phones, laptops
- High energy density
- Expensive, cobalt supply and ethical issues
- Moderate cycle life

NMC (Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide, LiNixMnyCozO2)
- Variants: NMC 111, 532, 622, 811
- Higher Ni → higher energy, lower cost
- Mn improves stability and safety
- Co improves conductivity and cycle life
- Widely used in EVs

NCA (Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide, LiNiCoAlO2)
- High energy, used in some Tesla packs
- High Ni, low Co
- Needs careful thermal management

LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate, LiFePO4)
- Lower energy density than NMC/NCA
- Very safe (strong P–O bond)
- Long cycle life (3000+ cycles)
- Good thermal stability
- Popular in EV buses, 2-wheelers, ESS

LMO (Lithium Manganese Oxide, LiMn2O4)
- Spinel structure
- High power capability
- Lower cycle life compared to NMC/LFP
- Sometimes blended with NMC


3. CATHODE PROPERTIES TO OPTIMIZE

- Specific capacity (mAh/g)
- Voltage vs Li/Li+
- Thermal stability
- Resistance to oxygen release at high SOC or high temperature
- Cost of raw materials (Ni, Co, Mn, Fe, P, Al)

4. DEGRADATION MECHANISMS (short view)

- Transition metal dissolution (Mn, Ni) into electrolyte
- Micro-cracking of particles
- Loss of active Li due to side reactions
- Structural phase changes with deep cycling

Cathode engineering uses:
- Doping
- Coatings
- Particle size control
to improve life and safety.
